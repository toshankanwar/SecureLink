# SecureLink Chat App

This project was started as a personal growth challenge to learn backend/server and mobile app development (Node.js + React Native CLI).
The src folder is fully usefull. currently facing native linkage issue and some gradle build issues, you can use src to make your own chat app eaily.
however i recreate it using expo in version 2 to tackle all issues.

However, due to multiple errors and spending too much time troubleshooting, I decided to stop working on it.  
*The project is not completed.*

Still, I learned a lot of new things through this process.
